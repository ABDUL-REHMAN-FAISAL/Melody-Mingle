# Melody-Mingle
It is a music recommendation system which helps us to learn DSA in a fun and creative way as it takes our love of music and links them with different data structures with the likes of the linklists and the stacks, the queues,the binary search trees of the world and helps us to make graphs and hash maps to help us undestand these concepts 

NOTE: it is not a finisled product as most projects are it just helps us to understand the basics of these structures and how to interlink and corelate them in a single and coherent working space
